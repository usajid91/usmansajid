    <h2>1. Start with Clear Objectives</h2>
    <p>Before you begin designing a Power BI dashboard, spend a little time understanding why the dashboard is needed. What business problem are you trying to solve? What are the key questions your users want answers to? When you know the purpose, you can choose the right visuals, highlight the right KPIs, and keep the report focused. A clear objective also helps you avoid adding unnecessary information that can confuse your audience. Simply put, a dashboard with a clear goal always performs better and delivers real value.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Use Consistent Color Schemes</h2>
    <p>Color is one of the most powerful tools in dashboard design. Using consistent colors makes your dashboard easy on the eyes and helps users quickly understand the data. Choose a small color palette—usually 3 to 5 colors—that matches your organization’s brand. Use strong colors only where needed, such as for KPIs or important trends. Light or neutral shades work best for backgrounds so your charts stand out clearly. A consistent color scheme keeps your dashboard clean, professional, and visually appealing.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Optimize Data Model Relationships</h2>
    <p>A dashboard may look simple on the surface, but the real magic happens in the data model behind it. A poor data model can make your dashboard slow, inaccurate, or difficult to maintain. Always try to build a star schema, with fact tables in the center and dimension tables around them. Avoid complex relationships like many-to-many or unnecessary bidirectional filters, as they can affect performance and cause unexpected results in DAX calculations. A well-structured data model ensures your dashboard runs smoothly and updates fast.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Implement Responsive Design</h2>
    <p>In today’s world, users open dashboards on laptops, tablets, mobiles, and even large screens in meeting rooms. That’s why it’s important to design dashboards that adjust well to different screen sizes. Power BI offers responsive features that automatically resize visuals without breaking the layout. Test your dashboard on at least two to three screen types to make sure that charts, numbers, and text remain readable everywhere. A responsive design helps all users interact with your dashboard comfortably, no matter where they view it.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Provide Context with Tooltips</h2>
    <p>Users often need extra information to fully understand what a number or trend means. Instead of filling the dashboard with too much text, use tooltips to give deeper insights when someone hovers over a visual. Tooltips can include definitions, comparison values, yearly trends, or even mini-charts. This keeps your main page neat while still helping users explore the data more meaningfully. Good tooltips reduce confusion and help users make quicker, more confident decisions.</p>
    
    <p>By following these best practices, you can build Power BI dashboards that are clear, informative, and truly useful. A well-designed dashboard not only looks good but also helps teams make smarter decisions every day.</p>
